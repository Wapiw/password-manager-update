# password-manager-update
you can cut down the code by only typing "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet"
but it mostly wont work atleast it didnt for me  

to install "cryptography"
type - pip install cryptography
After installing the cryptography library and using the correct import statement, you should be able to use the Fernet class for encryption and decryption in the password manager code.

#this is the new version of the password manager code
